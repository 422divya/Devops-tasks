**What is Devops?**

==> Devops is the method which uses automation tools for continuous integration and deployment to deliver the application faster. It minimizes the application development lifecycle and delivers the quality application.

**What is Automation, Scaling, Infrastructure**

==> Automation:

To make things work without manaul interventions is called automation. We can automate the server configuration, provisioning, monitoring etc using different automation tools like Ansile, shell scripting, chef etc to manage infrastructure with less human intervention.

==> Scaling:

Scaling is to increase the resources or add servers/system during high traffic for the application and to remove it during low traffic i.e scale down.
In vertical scaling we add more resources to the available instances like increasing RAM, CPU, disk etc and Horizontal scaling means that we need to add the new instances

==> Infrastructure:

We can manage infrastructure using code that can automate the configuration of it. For it we can use tools like Ansible, Terraform, shell script etc. 

It helps to provisioning the server, monitor and configure it with less manual efforts.

**Why DevOps is Important?**

==> By following devops practices application can be build and delivered faster. Also most of the daily tasks can be automated with automation tools and that time can be invested on making the application and infrastructure more secure and configuring it.
